
#### TaskDialog - moving beyond the MessageBox.

This an exploration of the [TaskDialog][1] addition to Windows UI programming, and patterns in [fasmg][2].

[Kenny Kerr][3] put together the original sample program in C++ when Windows Vista was still in beta. I thought it was such a good idea that I've mirrored his effort in x86-64 assembly. Obviously, we don't need the ATL/WTL or the wrapper he created - it's mostly just SendMessage.
